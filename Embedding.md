# Understanding Embeddings in LangChain

## What is an Embedding?
An **embedding** is a numerical representation of text (or other data) in a high-dimensional space. It is used to capture semantic meaning, allowing machines to compare and retrieve relevant pieces of information efficiently.

In LangChain, embeddings help find the most relevant document chunks for a given query by using vector similarity.

## How Does an Embedding Look?
Embeddings are typically represented as a list (vector) of floating-point numbers. Each number in the vector corresponds to a feature that captures some aspect of the meaning of the text.

Example of an embedding vector:
```python
[0.023, -0.182, 0.597, 0.045, -0.923, ...]
```
Each value in this vector represents a different aspect of the text's meaning, and vectors of semantically similar texts will be close to each other in the vector space.

## Relevancy and Embedding Scores
Each number in the embedding represents a **score** on a relevancy scale for different dimensions. When comparing query embeddings to document embeddings, similarity metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance determine how closely related they are.

For example, given a query embedding:
```python
[0.100, -0.300, 0.600, 0.050, -0.800, ...]
```
and a document chunk embedding:
```python
[0.102, -0.290, 0.610, 0.048, -0.810, ...]
```
A high cosine similarity score means the document chunk is relevant to the query.

## How LangChain Uses Embeddings to Optimize LLM Calls
LangChain follows these steps to reduce token consumption and improve response accuracy:
1. **Convert Documents into Embeddings**:
   - Each document is broken into smaller chunks.
   - Each chunk is converted into an embedding and stored in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).

2. **Query Embedding Generation**:
   - When a user asks a question, LangChain generates an embedding for the query.

3. **Similarity Search**:
   - The query embedding is compared against stored document embeddings.
   - The system retrieves only the most relevant chunks based on similarity scores.

4. **Concatenation and LLM Processing**:
   - Instead of sending all documents, only the top-ranked chunks are included in the prompt.
   - The LLM generates a response using the query + relevant chunks.

## Benefits of Using Embeddings in LangChain
✅ **Reduces Token Usage** – Only relevant chunks are sent to the LLM.
✅ **Faster Processing** – Less data means quicker API responses.
✅ **Improved Accuracy** – The LLM gets precise, context-rich inputs.

By leveraging embeddings, LangChain ensures efficient and cost-effective interactions with LLMs while maintaining high relevance in responses.
